# HotbarPets
HotbarPets is a [Slimefun4](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/) Addon.<br>
You need to install Slimefun4 in order for this plugin to work.

HotbarPets is a Slimefun4 Addon that is heavily inspired by the famous mod [InventoryPets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inventory-pets).
It adds new items to Slimefun that act like "Pets".
If you carry them in your Hotbar they can prevent you from taking certain types of damage, give you free items or Potion Effects.
But only if you also carry their favourite food with you.

## Download
You can download the updated version in the releases tab.

## Fork
This is a fork of the original HotbarPets addon. (original: [HotbarPets](https://github.com/Slimefun-Addon-Community/HotbarPets))
As such, I am only maintaining and not updating this addon. (lie, I added a few more pets to this one.)

## Optional Dependencies
If ProtocolLib is installed, this updated version will display the time remaining until a TimedPet's next feed
and whether or not the TimedPet is active.

## Issues
If you encounter any issues, open an issue. There's no guarantee I'll do it,
but at least I'll know about it.
